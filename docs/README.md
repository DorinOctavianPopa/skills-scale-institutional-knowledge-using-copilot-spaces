# DataStudio Project Management Overview

Welcome to DataStudio's project management documentation! This guide provides a concise overview of how we run projects, coordinate teams, and deliver value to our customers.

## Purpose

This documentation exists to help teams quickly understand DataStudio's approach to project management, including roles, artifacts, and processes. Whether you're a new team member or need a refresher, these docs will help you navigate our delivery practices effectively.

## Scope

These processes apply to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations at DataStudio.

## Core Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Ship small, testable increments to get feedback early
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

## Team Rhythm

- **Daily standups** (15 min): Focus on progress, blockers, and dependencies
- **Weekly sync** between PM and Product Manager: Align on priorities and risks
- **Twice-weekly delivery team standups**: Coordinate execution and remove blockers
- **Sprint demos/reviews**: Showcase progress at the end of each sprint or milestone
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: Keep leadership and partners informed

## Core Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and verify acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals

## High-level Lifecycle

1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, identify stakeholders, create project one-pager, establish high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, estimate scope, identify dependencies, create release plan
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, iterate. Track progress via project boards and regular standups
4. **Release**: Deploy to production, verify functionality, announce to stakeholders
5. **Retrospective**: Capture learnings, identify improvements, and plan next steps

## Key Artifacts

- **Project Charter / One-pager**: Problem, goal, success metrics, stakeholders, timeline
- **Roadmap and Release Plan**: Milestones and delivery schedule
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: Prioritized work items with acceptance criteria
- **Risk Register**: Tracked risks with impact, likelihood, owner, and mitigation plans
- **Release Notes**: Summary of changes, migration steps, and known issues
- **Retrospective Notes**: Learnings and action items for continuous improvement
