# OctoAcme — Process Checklists & Templates

## Purpose
Provide reusable checklists and templates to standardize common project activities, handoffs, and quality gates. These checklists help teams maintain consistency, reduce onboarding friction, and ensure critical steps are not missed.

## How to Use These Checklists
- Copy the relevant checklist into your project documentation or issue tracker
- Customize as needed for your specific project context
- Check off items as they are completed
- Use these as discussion points in planning and review meetings
- Reference these checklists in role handoffs to ensure clarity

## Cross-Role Handoff Best Practices

To ensure smooth handoffs between roles and phases:

1. **Document expectations clearly:** Use these checklists to define what "done" means for each handoff
2. **Schedule synchronous reviews:** Don't rely solely on async handoffs for complex work
3. **Maintain traceability:** Link artifacts across roles (requirements → designs → code → tests)
4. **Communicate early and often:** Flag potential issues before they become blockers
5. **Celebrate completions:** Acknowledge when handoffs are successful and learning occurs

## Customizing These Checklists

These checklists are templates. Adapt them to your project's needs:
- Remove items that don't apply
- Add project-specific requirements
- Adjust level of detail based on project complexity
- Integrate with your existing tools (GitHub Issues, Jira, etc.)
- Review and refine checklists based on retrospective feedback
