# OctoAcme — Project Initiation Guide

## Purpose
Define the initial steps to validate and authorize work, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan.

## When to use
Whenever a new project idea or feature proposal is ready to be explored.

## Goals
- Confirm business need and measurable outcome

- Decide go/no-go for planning

## Minimum Deliverables
- Project One-pager (Problem, Goal, Success Metrics)
- Stakeholder list & communication plan
- High-level timeline and key milestones
- Initial risk list
- Resource needs (team roles with role-level owners, rough effort estimate)
  - Note: Proposed team should list role-level owners (e.g., PM, PdM, Scrum Master, DevOps lead, UX lead, BA)
