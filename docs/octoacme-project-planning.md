# OctoAcme â€” Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- UX considerations (if applicable):
  - Design assets / prototypes needed
  - Accessibility requirements
  - User flows to validate
- DevOps / Infrastructure considerations (if applicable):
  - Infrastructure changes needed
  - Configuration updates
  - Monitoring / alerting requirements
  - Runbook / rollback plan link
- BA / Requirements traceability (if applicable):
  - Business requirement ID
  - Stakeholder approval needed
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Related docs/links:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Role Touchpoints During Planning

### Key Participants
- **Scrum Master:** Facilitates planning session, ensures timeboxing, tracks capacity
- **Product Manager:** Clarifies priorities, business value, and success metrics
- **Project Manager:** Reviews dependencies, risks, and cross-team coordination
- **Developers:** Provide estimates, technical feasibility input, flag dependencies
- **QA:** Define testing approach, identify test data and environment needs
- **UX Designer:** Present designs, clarify interaction patterns, confirm UX acceptance criteria
- **DevOps Engineer:** Review infrastructure needs, deployment considerations, pipeline changes
- **Business Analyst:** Ensure requirements are clear, traceability is maintained, stakeholder concerns addressed

### Expected Inputs by Role
- **UX:** Design specs, prototypes, accessibility requirements
- **DevOps:** Infrastructure readiness, deployment windows, monitoring plan
- **BA:** Requirements documentation, stakeholder sign-off status, acceptance test scenarios

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
